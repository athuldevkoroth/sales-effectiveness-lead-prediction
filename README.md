# Sales Effectiveness – Lead Potential Prediction (PRCL-0019)

## 📌 Project Overview
Sales teams often manage a high volume of leads, but not all leads contribute equally to revenue. Inefficient lead prioritization can result in wasted effort and missed business opportunities.  
This project analyzes **sales effectiveness** and builds a **machine learning classification model** to predict whether a lead is **High Potential** or **Low Potential**, enabling better sales prioritization.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand sales effectiveness patterns
- Identify key factors influencing lead conversion
- Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models
- Select the most suitable model based on performance and business relevance
- Demonstrate an end-to-end, leakage-free ML pipeline

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
- **Source:** MySQL database  
- **Records:** 7,422  
- **Features:** 9  

### Key Attributes
- Lead creation timestamp  
- Product identifier  
- Lead source channel  
- Sales agent  
- Delivery mode  
- Lead status  

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Verified and removed duplicate records
- Standardized column names for consistency
- Converted lead creation timestamps to datetime format
- Replaced invalid placeholder values in email fields
- Flagged invalid mobile numbers without dropping records
- Normalized categorical values to handle inconsistent text casing

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted to uncover sales effectiveness patterns:
- Distribution of lead statuses and conversion behavior
- Source-wise analysis of lead quality
- Delivery mode impact on lead outcomes
- Sales agent performance comparison
- Time-based lead generation trends  

Each visualization was accompanied by concise business insights.

---

## 🎯 Target Variable Definition
A binary target variable **Lead Category** was created using business logic:

- **High Potential:** Converted, Potential, In Progress Positive, Long Term  
- **Low Potential:** Junk Lead, Not Responding, Lost, In Progress Negative, Just Enquiry, Open  

This transformation simplified the prediction task while preserving business meaning.

---

## ⚙️ Feature Preparation
- Removed identifier fields such as email and mobile number
- Excluded raw datetime column to avoid unintended bias
- Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables
- Removed status-related features to prevent target leakage
- Performed class imbalance check:
  - Low Potential ≈ 62%
  - High Potential ≈ 38%
- No resampling techniques were applied due to mild imbalance

---

## 🤖 Model Building & Evaluation
The dataset was split into training and testing sets using **stratified sampling**.  
The following models were trained and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

### Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score  

Special emphasis was placed on identifying **High Potential** leads.

---

## 📈 Model Comparison & Selection
- Logistic Regression achieved higher accuracy but lower recall for High Potential leads
- Decision Tree improved recall but lacked stability
- **Random Forest provided the best balance between precision, recall, and F1-score**

✅ **Random Forest** was selected as the final model due to its balanced performance and business relevance.

---

## 💾 Model Persistence
The final trained Random Forest model was saved using **joblib**, enabling reuse and deployment without retraining.

---

## 🧪 Model Testing
A sample input was passed through the trained model to demonstrate prediction on unseen data.  
The model successfully classified lead potential and provided a confidence score, highlighting its real-world usability.

---

## 📊 Results & Business Impact
- Achieved realistic performance without data leakage
- Enables prioritization of high-value sales leads
- Improves sales efficiency and resource allocation
- Demonstrates an end-to-end, production-aware ML workflow

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
